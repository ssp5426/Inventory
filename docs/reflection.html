            <p>Some challenges one may face when it comes to website development, especially in html or any other general website such as wordpress, is how everything is mapped out and being capable of being able to navigate to each tool such as utilizing wordpress to create one website, in addition to getting used to all the syntax when it comes to coding it in html as I noticed while working on this assignment. When it comes to advantages, html in my experience has worked better when it comes to website development over using a website such as wordpress to create one since it felt more customizable as opposed to using a site to create and develop a website which took more time for me to understand the layout of wordpress as I have never used it before. When it comes to editing the layout and overall organization structures the challenges still appear at least to me as I attempted to do more exploring in wordpress as some of the options as I would anticipate a software like wordpress to have, surprisingly either did not have it or had a difficult way of getting to it, which was why in my opinion html would be best for overall customizing the structures and layout of the website knowing there are endless ways of doing it when it comes to coding anything. Some basic fundamental background skills that could be useful for creating both websites in html and wordpress are being aware of how you want to structure your website overall and being efficient when it comes to adding information so the code has easier ease of accessibility when it comes to reading the website. It could also be very important to understand how the fundementals of a website work and how it obtains that data. Most importantly, some skills that I would like to obtain are how to use wordpress more efficiently being that when I first started and still being a little present, I was still pretty shaky when it came to learning it but when it came to me coding it similarly in HTML, it went by a lot quicker as it felt that I had more options when it came to the overall structure even though it may not be much information as I wanted to keep it very simple at the same time for better accessibility.</p>
