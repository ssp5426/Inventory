            <h2>About Sunny Patel</h2>
            <p>Majoring in electrical and computer engineering technology was not only a primary interest, but discovering what’s inside to see how a computer really works from building various projects that involved wiring and debugging systems. At first, pursuing a degree in electrical and computer engineering technology sounded interesting, however, noticed that it’s more than what the program really is.
                I specifically chose to be an engineering technology major since my main interest is seeing how technology can also be utilized to solve real-world problems from a hands-on perspective. I am grateful for all the opportunities given to me so far which have benefited me with having the opportunity to see into the real world to support my future career with all the necessary skills that have been experienced to help prepare my career to be successful in the industry. 
                Complex problem solving was always a weak area of my interest, therefore wanted to have the opportunity to work in that field so I have the necessary experience later if needed with getting meaningful feedback on how I can work my weaknesses in a unique approach. Through internships, I hope to improve and demonstrate my skills to increase my degree-related experience.</p>
